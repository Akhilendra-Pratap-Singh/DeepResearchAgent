## 🚀 Overview

**Deep Research AI** is an intelligent multi-agent system that can conduct in-depth research on *any topic* with minimal human input.

Just provide a query (e.g., _"Impact of AI on carbon-neutral mining in India"_) — and it will automatically:

1. 🧭 **Plan** what web searches to perform.  
2. 🔍 **Perform** asynchronous web searches (via Tavily API).  
3. ✍️ **Synthesize** the results into a detailed 5–10 page Markdown report.  
4. 📧 **Email** the final report in HTML format using SendGrid.  
5. 💻 **Display** real-time progress via a Gradio-based interface.
